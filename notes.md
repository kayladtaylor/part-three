So, I couldn't figure out how choose multiple terms and see the correlation between them. However, I found a few very interesting articles when clicking on the term 'War', specially the one that starts off "The '_Indian_' war in America".

No such luck in making either of these into a widget, I kept getting a broken link error message when I clicked it, so I took away the "<frame>" part for each of them. The link brings me to the correct place. Also, checked discord and it seems like someone had the same issue as I did. I googled for a solution, did not find any, but that could be due to not asking the right question maybe.

In the second link, I specify all the terms of I have interest in and it was pretty neat to see the rise and fall of data. All but "Canada" had a spike around the same time in 1789.

No such luck with embeding the Google My Map on to here either...
