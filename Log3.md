# Log: Week Three
## Newcomer Sequence

This week we are asked to select 3 tutorials from a list of 5.
I will be attempting:
-   Voyant (Macroscopic Perspectives)
- Storymaps.js (Digital storytelling)
- Maps from Spreadsheets (Mapping)

## Voyant:
Side Note: What made me want to try this tutorial over the other _macroscopic perspectives_ tutorial, besides the fact that it looks more fun, was the statement that _"Voyant is the gateway drug to the digital humanities"_
