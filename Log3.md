# Log: Week Three
## Newcomer Sequence

This week we are asked to select 3 tutorials from a list of 5.
I will be attempting:
-   Voyant (Macroscopic Perspectives)
- Storymaps.js (Digital storytelling)
- Maps from Spreadsheets (Mapping)

## Voyant:
Side Note: What made me want to try this tutorial over the other _macroscopic perspectives_ tutorial, besides the fact that it looks more fun, was the statement that _"Voyant is the gateway drug to the digital humanities."_ I thought that it was a good seller for the tutorial.

Starting off: the data being studied for this tutorial is from _Dr. Melodee Beels_ study of _ways early newspapers reprinted articles from their competitors._ The video presentation that is posted of Dr. Beels speaking about her research lagged a lot, at first I thought it was my wifi, but them the images of the video kept skipping in and out. It was pretty hard to follow what Dr. Beels was trying to present, so I gave up on the video after about 10 minutes.

**Starting the Voyant tutorial:**
- I started off with clicking the link given to us of a subset of Dr. Beels' data. Dr. Graham was correct, I can not make anything from what the rows of code. Opening a page like that looks very intimidating!
- Going to the **Voyant Tools** website, as instructed I _right-clicked_ the **xlsx** like that Dr. Graham converted for us, _copied link address_ and pasted the URL to the '_Add Text_' box.
- Next, I clicked the options button at the right hand corner of the '_Add Text_' box and made the changes as instructed under the _'Tables'_ option. Changing the documents: *from cells in each row*, content: *10*, Author: *2*, and Title: *6+7+8*. Now that the appropriate changes are made, I clicked *ok*, and *reveal*.
  -   Okay, so this is actually super cool! I'm glad I got to see what the data looked like before hand and how this program changed it from looking like scary never-ending lines to something readable and fun! I can now see how this program is the *"gateway drug of digital humanities."*
  - **Corpus ID:** http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus+4b9b3df0da7b121a95981dca57af4c5
  - *__NOTE:__* I clicked the link I pasted above, to make sure it would work. It brought me to Voyant's homepage and not my corpus. Let's try that again!

  (*Side note: I had already closed out of the website before thinking to check the link, so I had to re-do the beginning of the tutorial! Lesson learnt: don't close the site before checking if the link works*)

  - **NEW Corpus ID:** https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=cbc3df633d95c833e6e601300fdf7f45
  AND IT WORKS!

- Okay, so back to the part where I couldn't watch the video, the next part of this tutorial asks to "_make note of some question you might ask_", I realized that their is an abstract and response written by _Adam Crymble_ on the presentation.

  - What newspaper was the biggest offender of stealing or I guess, used the *"scissors-and-paste"* method of journalism? However, upon seeing the data I don't think I'll be able to look into this.

- So looking around at the terms, reader and trends, I clicked different terms and read a few articles and played around with the different tools. This is super neat. However, I wasn't really able to find or see any patters. I tried selecting a few terms and using the side where it showed the trends, I changed the tool to show the links, but it only showed the links between the three top terms and small words associating them. Still very interesting to see. I did want to see if there were any trends or links between articles of the "_Indians,_" the British, Americans, and Canadians and if any articles came up about the wars. But again, as soon as I choose a tool, it gives me all the terms. I did find a small bit on an article that starts off "The '_Indian_' war in America" I added it to my "notes.md" as instructed by using the export function. I'm just hoping that I wont have any issues and the link will create a widget like it is supposed to.

## Storymaps.js

- I am really excited to do this project. Though I'm not too sure what to map.
  - I've chosen Mary Queen of Scots and her tragic story.
- The process of this seems pretty simple: Using my gmail address, I logged into _Storymap,_ and as instructed clicked options and selected my map type. I chose the _watercolour_ theme, it is by far the best one provided, in my opinion.
- I started with the _home slide_ giving basic information on my topic, added a picture and moved on to my first slide.
- I changed/ edited the location of my sides by enter an address or general location into the prompt bar at the bottom of the map "Search for location etc."  
  - Definitely took more time than expected to create my story map, though I didn't realize how much information I would need.

## Point Map with Google Maps

- Following the '_Point Map with Google My Maps_' tutorial from Chapter 7 of '_Hands-on Data Visualization_', I started by opening the '_Parks and museums data in Google Sheets_.' I went to **File> Make a Copy**, so that I can edit.
- Next I opened _Google My Map_ and created a new map. I named my map and added a description.
- Selecting '_Import_' under '_untitled layer_' and imported the data from my google drive.
- I continued the tutorial, following the prompts of _Google My Maps_, changing the icons, adding photos, adding lines or directions. (Though I took them off because I felt they didn't make sense there.)
- I finsished off the tutorial by going in to '_quick sharing_' and '_enabling link sharing_' and choosing the '_embed in my site_' option.
    - The embedding still is not working for me. I have tried googling how to embed html websites, I followed what they said, I also used one of their links that said it should embed as a widget, but it did not.
- Continuing on with this exercise, I googled Ottawa attractions, choosing only a handful of sights to see in this city, was really tough. Though I don't often realize it, there is a lot to see and do in Ottawa. It's also super amazing to find historical sites all over the city. So I chose some of my favourite places to visit. I put all the information regarding the locations of these sites in a google spred sheet to make for an easy upload. I then followed the instructions from the tutorial as I did before.
