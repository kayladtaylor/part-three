# Reflection: Week 3

Having taken a number of history courses throughout university, I have found the shift to digital history quite refreshing. There is a hump to overcome in the need to learn new tools and methods, something I am encountering right now; however, it offers more accessible information that is presented better, and with data-driven conclusions and sources. Reading through *Digital History and Argument*, the white paper documenting the practices of digital history, it was almost relieving to see many of my issues with traditional history identified. The paper identifies the counterintuitive citing of sources as paper, but using digital versions<sup>1</sup>. This has been an issue throughout my university experience, and is a relic of old methodology. The simple act of adding a link in a bibliography saves all future readers and users of your work of history!

This highlights the major difference between traditional and digital history: while the former is often times quite restrictive, the latter is designed to be open-sourced and collaborative. The white paper discusses the hesitancy to recognize digital history works by scholarly journals, and suggests on multiple occasions that journals review digital sources for future publication.<sup>2</sup> This is a good suggestion for future modernization of academia.



NOTE: As mentioned in my log, the video of Dr. Beels presentation wasn't working for me. So to get some sort of idea of what was spoken about, I read the abstracted and the '_Convenor's Response_' by Adam Crymble. I thought his response was particularly interesting and brought up really good points on the commercial publishers. I agree with him that charging a fee in order to access these digitized materials is unfair, everyone should be able access information regarding histories. But at the same time it's hard to be upset about it, these companies need to make money in order to keep doing their jobs. It made me think about how lucky we are, in universities to have sources at our finger tips, primary and secondary. As well as how lucky this generation of students are. I've always been able to go on to the internet and find out, more or less, anything I needed to or wanted to about a topic. (keeping in mind I didn't realize to look for critically sourced or peer-reviewed works before university.) I could not imagine physically having to sift through databases looking for huge books and archives in order to find something that **may or may not** even have what I'm searching for. (Though I say that now, but who knows where the future or school and/or employment might take me.)

It is really interesting going through these readings and others people studies and really getting to know what is actually happening in the field of digital history. Last assignment I answered a question pertaining about the difference between traditional history and digital history and how they conduct their research. _The value of traditional historians showing their work in comparison to what digital historians do._ In all honesty, I was not sure how to answer that question, but attempted to and did not do digital historians justice. I don't think I really understood at that moment, and I may still not. However, over the course of this semester and these assignments so far, I continue to gain new understandings and more appreciation for this field. What I didn't say in the last assignment was:

While there is value in traditional historians continue to work the way they do. Their research papers are examinations of primary sources from the time period and using secondary sources to further their arguments. They analyze what they can acquire and come up with theories to better explain their data.
However, in my opinion, digital historian's work is, or at least can be much more difficult. My thought at the beginning of this course was that digital historians take primary sources and digitize them, and while that may be some peoples jobs, like at the _National Library of Scotland_ for example. There are people out there who have made it their job to use digital tools to pick through *countless* amounts of documents in order to piece together lost histories, like those who's were lost to colonization, slavery or even hidden or lost literature written by women and a vast amount of other things and possibilities. Some digital historians are working on putting a stop to selective histories. And most importantly in my opinion is learning that failing is a part of the process, learning to look for help and learning to not give up. There is so much work behind what goes into digital history studies and projects, it continue to blow my mind. Digital history is more open, creative and collaborative.

## Story Mapping

The story mapping exercise was really interesting and fun to create. I am a creative person and take every opportunity to tell or write stories. I have been waiting since I was 16 to be able to do an assignment on Mary, Queen of Scots, I thought myself a bit of an expert on the subject, though I quickly found out there is much I didn't know, mostly little details, but those are the things that make stories interesting. First learning about Mary, Queen of Scots in a grade 11 history class, I became obsessed with the era and all the big female players at the time. It's initially what made me decide to study history. I feel like doing an assignment like this in other history courses could be so beneficial in learning and memorizing. I learnt so many interesting things that I never thought of looking up. However, I did end up going down a rabbit hole a few times and accidentally spent hours reading up on different events, other monarchs and important people. This assignment made me remember why I fell in love with history, all the knowledge and interesting things there are to learn out there. I feel that when you take multiple history courses every year with no other assignments other than essays and annotations, you begin to lose sight of why you chose to study history in the first place.
